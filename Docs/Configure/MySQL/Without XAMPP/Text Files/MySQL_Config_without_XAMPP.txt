MySQL Configuration without XAMPP (Windows)
-----------------------------

1. After the installation of MySQL is complete then, it will ask for `Product Configuration`.
2. In `Product Configuration`, there are multiple sections:
    - Type and Networking
    - Authentication Method
    - Accounts and Roles
    - Windows Service
    - Server File Permissions
    - Apply Configurations
3. For the `Type and Networking` section, click on the `next` button.
4. For the `Authentication Method` section, there are two options:
    - Use Strong Password Encryption for Authentication (RECOMMENDED)
    - Use Legacy Authentication Method (Retain MySQL 5.x Compatibility)
5. Select the first option which is `Use Strong Password Encryption for Authentication (RECOMMENDED)` and click on the `next` button.
6. In the `Accounts and Roles` section, write the `MySQL Root Password` according your choice and click on the `next` button.
7. In the `Windows Service` section, do not make any changes and click on the `next` button.
8. In the `Server File Permissions` section there are three options:
    - Yes, grant full access to the user running the Windows Service (if applicable) and the administrators group only. Other users and groups will not have access.
    - Yes, but let me review and configure the level of access.
    - No, I will manage the permissions after the server configuration.
9. Choose the first option which is `Yes, grant full access to the user running the Windows Service (if applicable) and the administrators group only. Other users and groups will not have access.` and click on the `next` button.
10. In the `Apply Configurations` section, click on the `Execute` button.
11. Following these steps the configuration of MySQL will be completed.
12. Once everything is complete, start the `MySQL Workbench` so that we can add the database of the users for the `Custom Drupal Modul`.
13. In the `Drupal Configuration` of `Set up database` add the `Database username` as `root` and `Database password` as the password for the `MySQL Server`.
14. In this case, we do not need to `start` the `MySQL server` in `XAMPP`.
