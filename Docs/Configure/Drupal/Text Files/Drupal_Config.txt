Drupal Configuration (Windows)
------------------------------

1. Make sure you start the XAMPP Web Server.
2. Go to `http://localhost/[replace_this_with_the_directory_name_where_the_project_is_stored]`. Eg: `http://localhost/event_registration`, the name of the directory where the project is stored is `event_registration`.
3. Once the site is open, it will ask to `Choose Language`.
4. After selecting the Language click on `Save and Continue`.
5. Now, it will ask to `Choose Profile`.
    - `Standard` (Install with commonly used features pre-configured.)
    - `Minimal` (Build a custom site without pre-configured functionality. Suitable for advanced users.)
    - `Demo: Umami Food Magazine(Experimental)` (Install an example site that shows off some of Drupal's capabilities.)
6. In our case, we can choose `Standard Profile` to test the custom module.
7. Click on `Save and Continue`.
8. After this we asked to `Verify requirements`.
9. In the `Verify requirements` section we can encounter with some error if not fixed properly.
10. Next section is the `Set up database`.
11. If we are using `MySQL Workbench` then the entered fields will be different and if we are using `phpMyAdmin` then the entered fields will be different.
12. Next Section is `Install site`.
13. In this section, the installation for the site will start.
14. After that we go to `Configure site` section.
15. In this section, fill these fields:
    - `Site Name`: `DesEM` (In our case)
    - `Site email address`: `bjyotibrat@gmail.com` (In our case)
    - `Username`: `BJYOTIBRAT` (In our case)
    - `Password`: Fill this according to the user.
    - `Email address`: `bjyotibrat@gmail.com` (In our case)
    - `Default country`: `India` (In our case)
    - `Default time zone`: `Kolkata` (In our case)
16. Click on the `check boxes` bellow the fields.
17. Click on `Save and Continue`.
18. Now the site will be running fine.
